Day 1: "Oh, another Minecraft update! Time to port my mod, should be easy."

Day 3: *staring at NeoForge docs* "What do you mean the networking system changed AGAIN?"

Day 5: `gradle build` FAILED
Me: "haha, I'm in danger :)"

Day 7: *in Discord*
Me: "guys how do I fix 'Could not load the value of field jvmArgumentProviders'?"
Some random helper: "did you try deleting .gradle?"
Me: "YES I DELETED EVERYTHING INCLUDING MY HOPES AND DREAMS"

Day 10: *talking to rubber duck*
"Listen here you little sh*t, I KNOW the mixin is correct. I've written it 9 times before. WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT INJECTING?!"

Day 15: *3 AM, surrounded by empty coffee cups*
// TODO: Fix this later
// Update: It's been 84 years
// Update 2: I'm losing my mind
// Update 3: The voices are telling me to use Fabric

Day 20: "Dear diary, today I learned that @Inject(at = @At("HEAD")) was working all along. I just forgot to add the mixin to mixin.json. I need a vacation."

Day 21:
*distant screaming*
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE WAS A 'COPY MIXIN METHOD SIGNATURE' BUTTON IN MY IDE ALL ALONG?!"

*commits changes*
git commit -m "feat: fixed everything (real)"
git commit -m "fix: fixed the fix that was supposed to fix everything"
